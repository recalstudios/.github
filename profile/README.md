## Hi there 👋

### 🙋‍♀️ Who are we?

Recal Studios is a software development company run by a couple dudes studying IT.
We do programming to have fun, and because we enjoy creating for others. Most of our
projects are open source, and can be seen on this organisation or on our own profiles.
We focus primarily on full-stack web development, but do some other stuff as well.

### 🌈 Contributing

We love people contributing to our projects, but haven't established contribution guidelines
just yet. Just make sure you check out our organisation projects and current code style,
and go nuts!

### 👩‍💻 Useful resources

We have [a website](https://recalstudios.net) that you could check out, as well as owning
[Yessness](https://yessness.com) and all its subpages.

### 🍿 (Not so) Fun facts

- We are unable to have a serious conversation without somehow ending up screaming at each other
- We all hate our own code, as well as the code of everyone else in the group
